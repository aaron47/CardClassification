# About this project:

A simple Computer Vision Model I wrote following a tutorial on Kaggle by Rob Mulla. based on the efficinetnet_b0 Image Classification model (for more info about this model visit: https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.efficientnet_b0.html)

This model just has to guess the type of card based on an image given to it. For example an Ace of Spades.
